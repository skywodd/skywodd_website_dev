# Skywodd website (development trunk)
## by Fabien Batteix (alias SkyWodd)

### Introduction

A wordpress.com blog is good for beginners, but for serious stuff it's simply not usable.
No custom themes, no plugins management, nothing except that wordpress.com allow you to use.

Two years after creating my blog (skyduino.wordpress.com) it's clear what this situation can stay as is anymore.

So, this new website CMS and his associated framework is designed to replace my old wordpress blog.
No more restrictions, no more wordpress, just what I need when I need it.

### Why this repo ?

This repository will store the lastest development version of my new skywodd website.

The source code is made to fit MY needs, but you can grab some parts of my code for your own projects.
(but don't forget the license !)

In fact it's just a barebone CMS with an HMVC framework, plus some extra for myself.

### License

The source code itself is published under the terms of the GPLv3 license.
**But the web design is keep under "all rights reserved", don't even think to copy it.**

---
### Documentation

The source code is documented using the PHPDOC standard.
I'v try to make the code documented as much as possible and in the most readable writing style.

But english is definitly not my native language so don't cry if you see some horrible grammar errors.
